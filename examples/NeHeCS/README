Created by Chris Hegarty.

This project provides a base class and three bridge classes for creating OpenGL applications using C#.  There is an example form and inherited class that demonstrates its use.

This code is free for use in any application.

If you have any comments or questions, you can reach me at avariant@hotmail.com.
